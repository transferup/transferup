            <h2>What We Do NOT Collect</h2>

            </ul>

            <h2>Data That Leaves Your Device</h2>
            <p>The only data that is transmitted from your device is when you use the AI Advisor feature:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chat messages:</strong> Questions and messages you send to the AI Advisor are sent to OpenAI's servers for processing</li>
                <li><strong>Context information:</strong> To provide better answers, we include your selected schools and major in the conversation context sent to OpenAI</li>
                <li><strong>Roadmap data (optional):</strong> If you ask questions about your progress, we may include information about your completed courses in the API request</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These messages are processed temporarily to generate responses and are handled according to OpenAI's data retention policies.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>TransferUp uses the following third-party services to provide functionality. These services may process data as described in their own privacy policies:</p>

            <h3>ASSIST.org API</h3>
            <p>We retrieve official course articulation data from ASSIST.org, California's official transfer planning database. When you view transfer requirements, the app queries ASSIST.org's public database. This does not require or transmit any of your personal information.</p>
            <p>ASSIST.org Privacy Policy: <a href="https://assist.org/privacy" target="_blank">https://assist.org/privacy</a></p>

            <h3>OpenAI API (AI Advisor)</h3>
            <p>When you use the AI Advisor feature, your messages and relevant context are sent to OpenAI's servers to generate helpful responses. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The questions you ask</li>
                <li>Your selected schools and major (to provide personalized advice)</li>
                <li>Information about your completed or planned courses (only when relevant to your question)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>OpenAI processes these messages according to their API data usage policy. As of our last update, OpenAI states that API data is not used to train their models. Messages are retained for a limited time for abuse monitoring and then deleted.</p>
            <p>You can avoid sending any personal data by not using the AI Advisor feature or by asking general questions without specific course details.</p>
            <p>OpenAI Privacy Policy: <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://openai.com/privacy</a><br>
            OpenAI API Data Usage: <a href="https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy" target="_blank">https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy</a></p>

            <h2>Your Control Over Your Data</h2>
            <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delete all data:</strong> Use the "Clear All Data" button in Settings to erase all information from your device</li>
                <li><strong>Delete specific courses:</strong> Remove individual courses from your roadmap at any time</li>
                <li><strong>Clear chat history:</strong> Delete your AI Advisor conversation history in the Advisor screen</li>
                <li><strong>Uninstall:</strong> Deleting the app removes all local data from your device</li>
                <li><strong>No account needed:</strong> TransferUp doesn't require creating an account, logging in, or providing an email address</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>Your data is protected by your device's built-in security features. We do not transmit your data over the internet except when you actively use features that require it (like the AI Advisor).</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>TransferUp is intended for college students (typically ages 17 and older). We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Since we don't collect any personal information, this policy applies to all users.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

            <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
            <p>Since TransferUp does not collect any personal information, California privacy laws (including CCPA) do not apply. We have no personal data to disclose, delete, or manage.</p>
